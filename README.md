# Consultation-Hour-Booking-System-for-APU-Medical-Center
***The project is in master branch***

This project I did with my friends during my degree studies. I have applied object oriented programming practice in this project. 
In this project we also implement MVC framework.  

This project involves the designing and implementation of a consultation hour booking system for APU medical center, it will be created for admin staff doctors to handle customerâ€™s bookings. The system will include user account management, appointment management, and report management for admins, and individual profile and individual appointment management for doctors. This project was created with the intent to utilize and practice object-oriented programming concepts in java such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

There are two library used in this project which are miglayout and LGoodDatePicker.
